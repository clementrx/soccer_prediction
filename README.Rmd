# Soccer game prediction

**Authors:** [Cl√©ment Rieux](https://github.com/clementrx)

The goal of this project, is to predict the outcome of a soccer match with the results of the last 5 matches from the season. (Consequently, we can't predict the first 5 match. Actually, yes but it will be biased)

I re-use his vizualisation, to plot a TV show rating from his IMDB notes.

## How it works ?

  - **Web scarpping (Part 1)** : To begin we neeed data, so we are using [BetExplorer](https://www.betexplorer.com/soccer/) to get all our data we need (history)
  - **cleaning** : Secondly, we need to clean and preprocess our data
  - **modeling** : Then try some modeling to find a good model to predict the results
  - **Web scrapping (part 2)** : Now we have our tools, we need data to predict (upcoming matchs)
  - **predict** : Predict outomes
  - **testing** : How our model is performing ?
